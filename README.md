## 🛠 How to Run (For people who know how node works)
Download, npm install and node start...

## 🛠 How to Run (For Total Beginners)

### 1. Install Node.js (if you don't have it)

👉 Download it from: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)  
Choose the **LTS** version and install it like any regular app.

After installing, open your Terminal or Command Prompt and run:

```
node -v
```

You should see something like `v18.XX.X` — that means Node.js is installed.

---

### 2. Download the Project

- Click the green **"Code"** button (top-left if you're on GitHub)
- Select **Download ZIP**
- Extract it on your computer

Or if you're using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IS_IT_LIVE_YET.git
cd IS_IT_LIVE_YET
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Inside the folder (in Terminal):

```
npm install
```

This installs the required packages (only `axios`).

---

### 4. Run the Script

```
node start.js
```

The script will now check FPL every 10 seconds. If it's not live, it'll open your browser.

---

## ❗ What You'll Need

- Internet connection
- A browser installed (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

---

## 📦 Included Files

- `start.js` – the script
- `package.json` – info about the project and its dependencies
- `.gitignore` – to exclude unnecessary files from Git
- `node_modules/` – automatically generated folder with required packages

---

## 👨‍🔧 Troubleshooting

- If you see `command not found: node` – Node.js is not installed correctly.
- If `npm install` fails – check your internet connection or permissions.

---

## 🎉 Done!

You're all set. Go play FPL — or cry about it like the rest of us.
